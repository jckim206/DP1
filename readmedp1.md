####Tracking historical Powerball numbers for patterns or trends with respect to timing

This is a mini project that I am going to try and complete on my own to evaluate historical Powerball numbers to see if there's any kind of pattern in the types of numbers or trends with respect to timing. My sense is that there is some sort of pattern that could narrow the odds slightly in your favor but no overall recipe to picking winning numbers. That said my goal is to answer the following questions

* basic statistical analysis
 * mean, median, mode
 * standard deviation
 * pearson's r and r^2 for regression analysis
* identify outliers
 * find numbers with the lowest pulls over the history
 * identify the most pulled numbers and their typical deviance from surrounding numbers
* Timing and average distance from adjacent numbers
 * find the average distance from one number to the next and find if those are represented by any kind of pattern year over year
 * compare the numbers pulled by 
  * odds vs evens
  * average distance to adjacent numbers
  * how many numbers per interval, defined as
   * Interval 1 - 1-10
   * Interval 2 - 11-20
   * Interval 3 - 21-30
   * Interval 4 - 31-40
   * Interval 5 - 41-50
   * Interval 6 - 51-60
   * Interval 7 - 61-69
  * numbers per interval over time
   * week to week
   * month to month
   * week of month
   * year over year
   * etc

The goal isn't to find a magic recipe to picking numbers but to try and see if there are any patterns or weights in their algorithm that enable slightly better odds.
